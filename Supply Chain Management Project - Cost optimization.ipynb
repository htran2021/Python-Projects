    "### SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT PROJECT\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### Company Background:\n",
    "ABC is the full scope retailer that has stores, warehouses and distribution centers. It has company-owned trucks for making deliveries to customers and picking up goods from suppliers. It also depends on third-party logistics (3PL) providers to support the company’s transportation requirements, especially from remote locations like seaports, river docks and rail yards. Alpha manages the transportation requirements as part of supply chain management (SCM) and strategic logistics management.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A transportation manager is expecting a number of vessels (e.g. two vessels) to arrive per day at the river port. The transportation manager is concerned whether the expected number of vessels will arrive on schedule. Each vessel only has two FEU containers. The transportation manager knows that the vessels may get delayed due to congestion at the port. The transportation manager also knows that the company must contract for third party logistics (3PL) trucking company to pick up the containers. The transit and delivery fees are fixed based on the load and distance (these costs are not part of the immediate considerations). Each truck can haul only 1 FEU container. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " In this example, we expect to have an average of two vessels arriving at the port daily. The dilemma is that fewer than two vessels may arrive, exactly two vessels may arrive, or more than two vessels may arrive. There is a significant uncertainty, and the company has to pay the below fees:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__The transportation manager has to pay fees for storing the containers at the dock if there are insufficient trucks to transport the containers from the docks upon arrival.The manager has to pay a storage fee for each container per day (e.g. $100 per container/day)__\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__The transportation manager has to pay fees to the 3PL trucking company if there are insufficient containers for the waiting trucks and some of the trucks have to return to their terminals empty. The manager has to pay a dry run cost for each empty truck (e.g. $200 per empty truck/day)__ \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " The storage fee at the port is $100 per container per day. The “empty truck return” fee is $200 per truck. Each truck can haul only 1 FEU container. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The transportation manager realizes that the Poisson distribution will provide perspectives about determining the best course(s) of action. The situation is difficult because the company cannot do anything to facilitate the arrivals of the vessels. The transportation manager most likely will have to pay fees unless the number of trucks available exactly matches the number of containers that arrive.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__Transportation manager’s objective is to minimize the amount of fees that may have to be paid? \n",
    "How many trucks should the transportation manager contract for so that the fees are minimized?__\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__The program will prompt the user for the number of trucks to optimize the truck rental fees based on the 3 inputs (average number of vessels coming to port, storage fee for each container per day, empty truck return fee). The average number of vessels must be positive and integer. The fees must be positive.__\n",

    "### Case Summary:\n",
    "The company expects an average of x vessels arrived at the port per day.\n",
    "Each vessel has two containers. Each truck only carries one container.\n",
    "If:\n",
    "A number of rental trucks > a number of containers: Pay dry run cost for $y per truck per day. \n",
    "A number of rental trucks < a number of containers: Pay storage fee for $z per container per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average of vessels (x) arrived, the dry run cost ($y), and the storage fee ($z) are the important factors as well as inputs that the user/manger has to determine. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Task:__ \n",
    "- Design a program that the user/manager will add average of vessels, dry run cost, and storage fee per day. \n",
    "- Then, we apply the Poisson Distribution to calculate the probability of each scenario based on the average of arrived vessels (e.g. 13% is the probability we have 0 vessel coming to port, 20% is the probability we have 1 vessel coming to port... ). To limit the scenarios we may have, the cumulative for the above cases can be set as 97%. The Poisson Distribution can be calculated by the following formula: \n",
    "  P(x; μ) = (e^(-μ) * μx) / x!\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  1. μ is the average of cases happens\n",
    "  2. x is the number of occurrences\n",
    "  3. x! is the factorial of x\n",
    "  4. e is Euler's number (2.71828)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the cost based on the dry run cost and storage fee for each rental option (rent 0 truck, 1 truck, 2 trucks...). Use the above calculated probability and cost for each rental option to calculate the total costs. \n",
    "- Print the total cost for each rental option and make a final conclusion about how many trucks we should rent and how much the cost may be incurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Output Example:__\n",
    "- Ask users to add an input: What is the average of vessels arrived at the port? If the result is negative or not an integer number. Let them know the issue and request them to input a number again. \n",
    "- Ask user to add a storage cost input: How much does a storage cost for each container per day? The input has to be positive\n",
    "- Ask user to add a dry run cost input: How much does a dry run cost for each truck per day? The input has to be positive\n",
    "- Print the total cost for each scenario. For example: the total cost for renting 0 truck is: $350, the total cost for renting 1 truck is $450...\n",
    "- Draw a conclusion from the above statement to show the manager which option is the best. Print \"In order to minimize the total cost, we should rent X trucks. The total cost is $Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Brainstorming:__\n",
    "- Create the factorial function to use it in the main function\n",
    "- Ask the user/manager to input three main data: average of vessels, storage cost, and dry run cost.\n",
    "- Use While,Try,Except to keep asking the user if they don't use the right data type. \n",
    "- Determine how many vessels/scenarios we should include in the function. The cumulative prob for all cases can be set as 98%. Put a determined number of vessels into a list\n",
    "- Create a list of a number of trucks to assess the total cost for each scenario. \n",
    "- Multiply the total cost for each rental truck scenario (0 truck, 1 truck, 2 trucks...) and the probability for each vessel (0 vessel,1 vessel coming). \n",
    "- For example: The total cost for 0 truck = __Probability for 0 vessel__ * __Total Cost incurred with 0 rental truck while 0 vessel comes to port__  + __Probability for 1 vessel__ * __Total Cost incurred with 0 rental truck while 1 vessel comes to port__ +.... \n",
